This directory contains the summary statistics for the paper Estrada et al, Nat Comm, 2018
A meta-analysis of two case-control GWAS for Neuromyelitis Optica was conducted on 1459 samples.
The first dataset contained whole-genome sequence data and the second dataset was based on imputed GWAS. 

An inverse variance meta-analysis was performed, only variants present in both studies are reported here. 

A three analyses are reported here:
NMO-IgG auto-antobody positive (NMO.IgGPos.gz)
NMO-IgG auto-antobody negatvie (NMO.IgGNeg.gz)
Combined NMOIgG+ and NMOIgG- (NMO.Combined.gz)
